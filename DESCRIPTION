Description: This package facilitates simulating pooled genetic screens and
  single cell phenotyping. The question is for a given library size and a
  cell-level classifier, on average how many cells of different genotypes and
  how many wells are needed to accurately classify a genotype as having the
  phenotype? This package complements the SpaCR package.
